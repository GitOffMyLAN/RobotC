## Evaluations
### Jack's Evaluation

#### Working
In the beginging I was controling and was not thinking of my parnert which meant our team was workign at half work for about one or two weeks. This was a waste of time but by the end we were working toughter well and that lead to use to succsed in our project. But if I was to do this again I would think about my parnert and work better in a team.
